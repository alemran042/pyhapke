# pyhapke
## Created by Jordan Ando

pyhapke is an implementation of Hapke's radiative transfer model (Hapke 1981), which is commonly used to model planetary surfaces. This model can be used to relate reflectance to single-scattering albedo of various materials. This library was created as part of the research for the author's PhD in Earth and Planetary Sciences. Included constants consist primarily of relevant physical properties lunar regolith and ice, as well as standard viewing geometries.

pyhapke is designed to run with numpy and scipy as its primary dependencies, which are commonly found in other scientific Python applications, and can be easily installed through Anaconda or pip.
